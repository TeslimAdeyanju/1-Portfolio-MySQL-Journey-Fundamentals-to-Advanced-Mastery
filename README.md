Welcome to my SQL Journey! This repository is a living record of my exploration into SQL and MySQL, highlighting essential skills like column and table aliases, joins, aggregations, and conditional filtering. Each section represents a milestone in my learning path, crafted to deepen my understanding of SQL‚Äôs power and versatility in real-world data analysis.

But here‚Äôs the fun part: I've also added a dash of Python magic to bring my SQL queries to life! Using `mysql.connector`, I connected directly to MySQL from Python, and with the help of `pandas`, I transformed raw query results into clean, easy-to-read data frames. This combination lets me explore data faster and visualize results right within my Python scripts‚Äîturning each query into an interactive experience.

## üìÇ Portfolio Overview

This portfolio is divided into sections that document the steps I‚Äôve taken to develop SQL proficiency. From foundational techniques to advanced capabilities, each area represents a building block in my journey. Whether it‚Äôs querying data, joining tables, or even building out complex subqueries, I‚Äôve demonstrated not only my SQL skills but also my Python prowess, giving you an end-to-end view of how I bring data to life with both languages.

Join me as I uncover insights from SQL through interactive Python displays, each dataset telling its own story in neat, pandas-powered frames. Let‚Äôs dive into the journey!

### 1. üß≠ MySQL Basics

This is where my journey began, learning the fundamental SQL operations needed to manage and query data. Understanding the basics of SQL was crucial in building a solid foundation for more complex tasks.

- **[Querying Data](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/01_mysql_basics_querying.sql)**: My first SQL statements! Here, I learned how to retrieve data from tables using simple `SELECT` queries.
- **[Sorting Data](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/01_mysql_basics_sorting.sql)**: I explored the power of organizing results with `ORDER BY`, a vital tool for any analyst.

---

### 2. üîç Filtering Data

Moving forward, I learned how to filter data precisely, allowing me to refine my queries for specific insights. These techniques taught me how to extract just the data I needed from large datasets.

- **[WHERE and DISTINCT](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/02_filtering_data_where_distinct.sql)**: Filtering rows was a game-changer! I learned to apply conditions to hone in on relevant data and eliminate duplicates.
- **[Pattern Matching](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/02_filtering_data_like.sql)**: Discovering `LIKE` opened up new possibilities in pattern matching, making queries adaptable to flexible conditions.

### 3. üåê Joining Tables

Joining tables felt like unlocking a new dimension in SQL. Here, I learned how to combine data from multiple sources, an essential skill for creating comprehensive data reports. Each type of join has taught me different approaches to merging datasets, allowing me to choose the best method based on the results I need.

- **[INNER JOIN](https://github.com/TeslimAdeyanju/My-SQL-Journey-From-Fundamentals-to-Advanced-Data-Mastery/blob/main/3-Joining%20Tables/2-inner_join_sql_portfolio_notebook.ipynb)**: I started with INNER JOINs, which only bring together data when matches exist in both tables. This join type is perfect when I need results that meet strict criteria across two tables.

- **[LEFT JOIN](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/03_joins_left.sql)**: LEFT JOIN introduced me to the importance of keeping unmatched data from the left table. When there‚Äôs no corresponding data in the right table, it fills the gaps with `NULL`. This join is especially useful when I want all data from the primary table (left table) and any matched data from the secondary table.

- **[RIGHT JOIN](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/03_joins_right.sql)**: Learning RIGHT JOIN was the reverse experience of the LEFT JOIN. Here, I keep all data from the right table and match it with the left table where possible. If there‚Äôs no match in the left table, SQL fills the missing entries with `NULL`. This approach is valuable when my primary interest is in the complete dataset of the right table while including any relevant data from the left table.

- **[SELF JOIN](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/03_joins_self.sql)**: SELF JOIN opened up a unique perspective by allowing me to join a table to itself. This is useful when comparing rows within the same table, such as finding pairs of employees with the same manager or comparing dates within a single dataset. By using table aliases, I could treat the same table as two distinct entities in the query, expanding the scope of analysis I could perform within a single dataset.

- **[CROSS JOIN](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/03_joins_cross.sql)**: CROSS JOIN introduced me to the concept of a Cartesian product, where every row from the first table is paired with every row from the second table. This type of join creates all possible combinations, which is helpful in scenarios like generating test datasets or creating combinations of different attributes. While it‚Äôs powerful, I learned to use it carefully to avoid unintentionally large result sets.

Each of these join types gives me control over how I handle matched and unmatched data across tables, allowing me to build robust, comprehensive datasets tailored to specific analytical needs. From precise filtering with INNER JOIN to comparing entries within a single table using SELF JOIN, I‚Äôve learned how to approach complex data relationships with flexibility and depth.

### 4. üìä Aggregations and Grouping

Aggregations were my introduction to data summarization, where I could extract valuable insights from groups within my data. Grouping allowed me to observe trends and analyze data at a higher level.

- **[GROUP BY](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/04_aggregations_group_by.sql)**: With `GROUP BY`, I began to organize my data into meaningful categories.
- **[HAVING](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/04_aggregations_having.sql)**: Filtering groups with `HAVING` brought in-depth analysis, allowing me to set conditions on aggregated results.

---

### 5. üß© Subqueries

Subqueries opened up new ways to approach SQL challenges, letting me nest queries to handle more complex data scenarios. This section highlights how I learned to structure queries within queries.

- **[Simple Subquery](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/05_subqueries_simple.sql)**: My first attempt at subqueries, where I embedded one query inside another.
- **[Derived Table](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/05_subqueries_derived_table.sql)**: Using subqueries as temporary tables helped simplify complex query structures.

---

### 6. üõ†Ô∏è Set Operations

Learning set operations like `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` allowed me to combine or compare result sets. These operations expanded my ability to compare datasets and unify results across different queries.

- **[UNION](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/06_set_operations_union.sql)**: `UNION` became a valuable tool for merging datasets without duplicating entries.

---

### 7. üóÑÔ∏è Database and Table Management

Managing databases and tables helped me gain confidence in SQL as a backend developer's tool. Here, I learned to create and modify databases and tables, a vital skill for managing structured data.

- **[CREATE DATABASE](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/07_database_management_create_database.sql)**: Setting up databases from scratch!
- **[CREATE TABLE](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/07_database_management_create_table.sql)**: Designing table structures taught me the importance of data organization.

---

### 8. üîê Constraints and Data Integrity

As I advanced, I learned how to use constraints to enforce data integrity. Constraints ensure that data entries are consistent and reliable, essential for trustworthy databases.

- **[PRIMARY KEY](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/08_constraints_primary_key.sql)**: Defining unique identifiers for each table row.
- **[FOREIGN KEY](https://github.com/yourusername/sql-code-portfolio/blob/main/08_constraints_foreign_key.sql)**: Creating relationships between tables by linking primary keys.
